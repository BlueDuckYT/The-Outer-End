     * spawning of the mob that will never stop.

     *       ambient, or misc mobs. Use that event to add/remove mobs from structures

     * This is where extra checks can be done to determine if the structure can spawn here.

     * do any biome checking here as you should've added this structure to
     * the biomes you wanted already with the biome load event.
     *
     * Basically, this method is used for determining if the land is at a suitable height,
     * if certain other structures are too close or not, or some other restrictive condition.
     *
     * For example, Pillager Outposts added a check to make sure it cannot spawn within 10 chunk of a Village.
     * (Bedrock Edition seems to not have the same check)

     * another mod's dimension is trying to spawn your structure, the locate
     * command will make minecraft hang forever and break the game.
     *
     * Instead, use the addDimensionalSpacing method in StructureTutorialMain class.
     * If you check for the dimension there and do not add your structure's
     * spacing into the chunk generator, the structure will not spawn in that dimension!
