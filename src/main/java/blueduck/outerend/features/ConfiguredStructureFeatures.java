        // prevent any sort of crash or issue with other mod's custom ChunkGenerators. If they use
        // FlatGenerationSettings.STRUCTURES in it and you don't add your structure to it, the game
        // could crash later when you attempt to add the StructureSeparationSettings to the dimension.
        //
        // (It would also crash with superflat worldtype if you omit the below line
        //  and attempt to add the structure's StructureSeparationSettings to the world)
        //
        // Note: If you want your structure to spawn in superflat, remove the FlatChunkGenerator check
        // in StructureTutorialMain.addDimensionalSpacing and then create a superflat world, exit it,
        // and re-enter it and your structures will be spawning. I could not figure out why it needs
        // the restart but honestly, superflat is really buggy and shouldn't be your main focus in my opinion.
